# Notes 

### Two problems I face while solving algorithms
1. mathematical analysis
2. Pattern recognition

I have noticed I approach problems in a brute force manner. However, from solutions I have encoutered, I have learnt that I should try and find a pattern and see how that can be used to optimize my code.


Patterns I have noticed so far
===============================
1. Rise, fall, valleys and peak pattenrs of numbers
2. When there are sequential numbers that are scattered and you ned to find minimum actions to take a sorting algorithm will most likely be the clue.
