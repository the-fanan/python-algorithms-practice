#Data structures and Algorithms in Python by Goodrich, Tamassia and Goldwasser

# a GRAPH is a way of representing connections or relationships between pairs of objects from some set V

# VERTICE (node) are the objects sharing a relationship
# EDGE (arc) connect from one vertice to another and may be DIRECTED or UNDIRECTED
# PATH is a sequence os alternating EDGES and VERTICES. Starts and ends at a VERTICE
# CYCLE is a PATH that starts and endsat the same VERTICE
# A PATH is SIMPLE if each VERTICE is didtinct
# A graph is ACYLIC if it has no DIRECTED CYCLES
